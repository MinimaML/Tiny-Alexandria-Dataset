**Alexandria 100k** is a high-quality, reasoning-dense dataset designed to train "Thinker" models. Unlike standard instruction datasets that focus on short answers, Alexandria explicitly targets **internal reasoning**, **chain-of-thought**, and **detailed explanations**.

Generated by **Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Thinking**, this dataset refines raw knowledge into structured, pedagogical lessons.

## 📊 Dataset Statistics
*   **Total Samples**: 100,000
*   **Generator Model**: Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Thinking
*   **Formats**: JSONL (Prompt, Completion, Category)
*   **License**: Apache 2.0

## 🧠 Categories & Methodology
The dataset is strictly curated into five "Buckets," each designed to train a specific capability of the Student model:

| Bucket | Source Domain | Focus Capability | Distribution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Academic** | FineWeb-Edu | **Factuality & Logic**: Converting raw text into textbook-style explanations with reasoning steps. | 35% |
| **Instruction** | UltraChat | **Obedience & Planning**: Handling complex user requests with a "Thinking" phase before answering. | 25% |
| **Creative** | TinyStories | **Coherence & Fantasy**: Writing engaging narratives with consistent character logic. | 15% |
| **Code** | MBPP / The Stack | **Algorithmic Thinking**: Solving coding problems with step-by-step logic and comments. | 10% |
| **Memory** | Wikitext-103 | **Long-Context Retrieval**: "Needle in a Haystack" tasks to train context window utilization. | 15% |

## 🛠️ Usage
**Suitable for "Instruction Pre-training" (From Scratch)**:
The dataset includes a `text` field which combines the source and the reasoning. This format is ideal for training **Phi/Orca-style models** from scratch, as it teaches the model both the knowledge and the thought process simultaneously.

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

dataset = load_dataset("Wilbatronic/alexandria-100k")

# Pre-training (Text Column)
# text = "Concept... \n\n Analysis..."
```
